In the Middle Ages, the universe was viewed as a great machine whose creation and functioning reflected harmony in both proportion and symmetry. These qualities were imparted through the design by its Creator. Scholars of this period conceived the Christian God as the Great Geometer whose compass served as the “tool of creation”. They believed that God brought order to a divided earth in chaos. Things that look like the earth, sun, and stars, as well as the formless chaos awaiting its geometric formation in the middle. We can see in this picture, the Circle God is drawing is filled with This picture is a 13th century illustration was the frontispiece of the French Bible Moralisee. It depicts this belief of sacred geometry, which ascribes symbolic and sacred meanings to certain geometric shapes and certain geometric proportions. These geometric designs were used in the design and construction of religious structures, such as churches, temples, and mosques. And to pursue these principles was therefore to pursue and worship God.

During the Pre-Socartics era, Greek philosophers had started to consider the possibility that the Earth was not at the center of the universe nor was it stationary. For example, Anaximander proposed that the cosmos was infact spherical, and that the earth was stationary at its center. While the Pythagoreans proposed that the cosmos was spherical, that there was a fire in the center of the cosmos, and that the earth, moon, sun, and five visible planets rotated around this central fire. Aristarchus later proposed that the sun was the center of the cosmos and the earth rotated around the sun. A major reason for the dominance of the geocentric and geostatic model of the cosmos was Aristotle’s physics. His “physics” reflects his account of the natural world. There are two main differences between Aristotle’s physics and our modern physics.
First, Aristotle’s physics was qualitative, not quantitative. However, he did believe that mathematics was the proper language for describing the physical world. The second major difference between Aristotle’s physics and modern physics, is that his physics encompassed the entire natural world, and did not separate biology from astronomy. He proposed that the cosmos could be split into two separate realms, terrestrial and celestial. He describes that everything in the terrestrial realm could be split into four qualities, and describe how each element had a natural motion and a natural place. One of the key differences is the idea of substance. Unlike modern physics, he believed that the cosmos is not made up of elementary particles, but substances. Aristotle believed that shape, organization, and final cause, are essential to the understanding of substance, or formed matter.
Aristotle physics was a fundamental understanding of matter and space that was consistent with logic and experience, which makes him an important figure in the advancement of science. Other main theories of Aristotelian physics are natural position, gravity, infinite universe, and continuum theory.

The photo is a 16^th^ century engraving of  a crowned Ptolemy,
or Cladius Ptolemaeus, guided by the Muse of Astronomy, Urania, from Margarita
Philosophica by Gregor Reisch, showing an early confluence between Ptolemy and
the rulers of Ptolemaic Egypt. Ptolemy was a Greek-Egyptian mathematician, astronomer,
geographer, astrologer, and music theorist. In the photo, we see an instrument used
by Ptolemy, a quadrant to measure the altitude of the moon. Urania, a character
of Greek mythology, was the muse of astronomy. She dresses in a cloak and keeps
her eyes and attention focused on the heavens. She is often represented with a
celestial globe to which she points to with a little staff (located in the
lower left). Ptolemy is most remembered because of his development of the
geocentric cosmological system.  He is
the author of numerous scientific theories which were of continuing importance
to both Islamic and European Science. Perhaps his most important work, the
Almagest, contained his work on astronomy, philosophy, and mathematics.

The Hellenistic period of ancient Greek and Mediterranean history between the death of Alexander the Great in 323 BCE and the emergence of the Roman Empire. During this era, there was a
transition from the concept of philosophers to the title of mathematicians, which
not only relate to what we know as mathematical research, but any type of
learning.  Aristotle argued that we must first study arithmetic and geometry to help us define physics. Although mathematics existed long before this era, these new mathematicians made many advancements by trying to rigorously prove theorems, and the discoveries made by these Greek mathematicians, including Pythagoras and Euclid, are still used in mathematical teaching today. Important developments include basic rules of geometry, formal mathematical proof, discoveries in number theory, mathematical
analysis, and applied mathematics. For example, the article states that in his work, “The Elements of Geometry”, does not contain much propositions and proofs that are discovered but him, but is highly systematic, a clear, coherent, and coordinated collection of mathematical proofs. Starting from a few self-evident axioms, and according to logical principles, he deduced a series of propositions as a basis, and created a general structure of deduction of axioms, a basis of geometry. Another famous mathematician, as well as astronomer and geographer Archimedes, is known for devising the first system of latitude and longitude, calculated the circumference of the earth, and the “Sieve of Eratosthenes” algorithm for identifying prime numbers. The advancement of mathematics during this era helped define its role. In previous centuries, the role of mathematics and its relationship with philosophy could be considered
uncertain. However, in this era, mathematics has become its own field in science. The clear, systematic, and mythological displays of proofs by these mathematicians is what makes it different than classical Greek science. They also recognized that mathematics could be applied to solve physical problems,
in areas such as astronomy.

This is a picture of the Salisbury Cathedral Clock in
England. It is perhaps the oldest working mechanical clock, dating back to
1386, and perhaps was made even earlier.  It is made from hand-wrote iron and was
created by three horologists, Johannes and Williemus Vrieman and Johannes
Jietuijt of Delft. Clocks, like many others at its time, was built as a means
to remind the locals that the churches services were about to start. It chimed
a bell every hour, for 24 hours a day. Before mechanical clocks, people didn’t
really need to know the precise time, just perhaps when to go to church and when
to eat. The clocks of ancient times relied on some sort of repetitive process,
such as the rising and setting of sun for sundials, or the water clocks that
measured the dripping of water. Most people split the day and night into 12 “temporal
hours”, which varied throughout the year. However, the Salisbury clock was an
example of how clock makers had shifted to measuring small increments of time.  It is a system of weights and pulleys that is
reset every morning. The key structure is the “verge and foliot”, a mechanism
that maintains the slow descent and the keeping of time.

为什么大学独独出现在基督教欧洲而不是文教鼎盛的古代中国或古代希腊？Why
did universities only appear in Christian Europe instead of ancient China or
ancient Greece where culture and education flourished?

There are many reasons why universities
did not appear academically prosperous civilizations like Greece and China, but
it appeared in medieval Europe. The first point that the article emphasizes is
the idea of autonomy. Starting from the 11^th^ century, self-governing
regimes of free people formed by merchants and handcrafts started to enjoy
autonomy, no longer bound to feudal masters and laws. Many European cities opened
up various stadiums to meet the growing interest toward Greek academic and Roman
Law. Guilds consisting of teachers and students resulted in the autonomous institution
known as university. Universities were considered a legal entity with the right
to its own relationships, the recruitment of members and formulate its own
constitution, rights, and privileges. Universities also formed self-protection
treaties with city authorities to maintain its own interests. There were well
defined standards for both professors and students.  The second point why is that the university
helped provided universal academic standards. Once a university obtained a
charter from the Pope, the university would become a pan-European institution
with universal significance, leading to a universal academic standard. A degree
awarded by a university would be recognized throughout Christian Europe, just
like teaching standards and qualifications are. Having such standards ensured
that each university provided students with qualified academic training.  The universities were based on the teaching
of the art of freedom, which consisted of seven fundamental courses that free
people should undergo, including Trivium and Quadrivium, ideas originating from
Rome and Greece. Despite the so-called dark years, European universities not
only were able to continue the spirit of Greek free academics, but become
institutionalized under new social and historical conditions, forming the basis
of free academics. The last reason is the use of debate as the main teaching
method. Aside from lectures, debates were used to allow students to use the
knowledge they have learned, to further analyze and criticize the texts they
have read and express their thoughts about it. This raised “problem awareness,”
the basis of academic research. The article reasons that this is the fundamental
gap between Chinese Universities and other World-Class Universities.  Political, cultural, and ideological changes
in Christian Europe allowed universities to develop before they did in other
places. Improving economic development and an emerging urban class with demands
to break the church’s overwhelmingly arbitrary status in education resulted in the
formation of unions and guilds. Guilds consisting of teachers and students would
form universities, which were fully autonomous institution, and with a universal
standard, would make universities universal all across Europe.

Picture

This is a picture representing Ernest Board’s Portrayal of Roger Bacon in his observatory at Merton college. In the picture, Roger Bacon observes the sky through optical lens. The structure to the table to the left of him is an armillary sphere, which is a model of the celestial sphere invented by eratosthene. Roger Bacon is an English Franciscan philosopher, mathematician, astronomer, and alchemist from Ilchester, Somerset. Bacon was well known for his precocious expression of the empirical spirit of experimental science, one of the earliest supporters of the modern scientific methods across Europe. He was criticized by religious authorities as his techniques and methods were deemed to be too radical. Bacon was also famous for many inventions and innovations, including optics, redefining gunpowder, and the modern calendar. He made predictions about man controlling nature, land, air, and undersea travel.

Writing

In ancient Greek, scholars such as Aristotle believed that
some agent would keep rotating the “giant crystal sphere” to keep the stars
moving. By the sixth century CE, however, philosopher Johannes Philoponus
rejected this idea and believed that once a body is set in motion, it will keep
moving in the absence of friction, and thus the celestial bodies will keep
moving because there is nothing that opposes them. In this, it is believed that
once a body is set into motion, and as long as the impulse is greater than resistance,
then the body would continue to move. It was also concluded that a body with greater
speed and/or greater mass means greater impulse. These ideas were adopted by
the 14^th^ century. William of Ockham and Jean Buridan called this
quality of motion as impetus and avoid persecution by declaring that God was
the initiator of impetus, and thus had the ability to change motion if he
pleased. Galileo’s experimentations also proved that impetus or something
similar to it must be true, and he became very close to the modern idea of
inertia.

The main difference between impetus and modern idea inertia
is that inertia applies both to bodies at rest and to bodies in motion. Before
Newton, none of the philosophers had thought that the same concept could
describe stationary and moving bodies. It is also more well defined that
inertia can be applied in a circular motion, which describes why celestial
objects move in a circle.

This picture, titled Drawings of the Moon, was created by
Galileo. It depicts hand drawn watercolors of the Moon in its various phases,
as he observed the Earth’s satellite through a telescope in the autumn of 1609.
It represents the first realistic depiction of the Moon in history. Due to Galileo’s
training in art and chiaroscuro, he was able to clearly depict the mountains
and craters on the surface of the moon. By comparing light and shadow in the vicinity
of the terminator (dividing line between light and shadow), he was able to
deduce the cause of the uneven waning as a result of these mountains and craters.
Previous to Galileo’s depiction, an English mathematician Thomas Harriot uses a
perspective tube to observe the moon and did report a “strange spottiness” in
the waning of the crescent but did not put significance on it. Even further in
the past, philosophers and scientists such as Aristotle believed that celestial
bodies were perfectly smooth and spherical.

Copernicus’s great work 《De
revolutionibus orbium coelestium》should
be translated into 《On the
Movement of the Celestial Sphere》instead
of 《On the
Movement of the Celestial Body》.
The “celestial sphere” is the basic concept of Greek mathematical astronomy,
and Copernicus is the authentic heir of this tradition of mathematical astronomy.
It is emphasized that the “celestial sphere” is not a “celestial body” and is
to restore the truth of history of science. The key problem lies in the
understanding of the word “orbium”. For Copernicus, this term does not refer to
the “celestial body” that we can easily accept today, but instead refers to the
“celestial sphere” that ancient astronomers believed to drive the celestial
bodies to move. This is directly related to the historical attitude that we
should have evaluating scientific theories, which effects what we are able to
achieve and learn when reflecting on the modern science caused Copernicus. This
translation from “celestial sphere” to “celestial body” may be deliberately or
unintentionally viewing Copernicus from today’s perspective, instead we should
look at it as did the Greek philosophers. There was no concept of celestial
bodies at that time. Celestial body refers to the material form of the
universe, it is the agglomeration of various astronomical states such as suns, planets,
asteroids, etc. The “celestial sphere” is a basic concept of Greek mathematical
astronomy, and changing it back is to restore the truth of the history of
science.

This is a painting by William Blake, a Romantic painter and poet. In this work, Blake portrays a young and muscular Isaac Newton, rather than an older figure of popular imagination. He is crouched naked on a rock covered with algae, which appears to be at the bottom of the sea. All his attention is focused on the diagram that he draws to what seems to appear to be a reference to Newton’s theory of optics on a scroll. He uses a compass to do so. Blake was critical of Newton’s reductive, scientific approach and shows that he is merely following the rules of his compass, blind to the colorful surroundings. Blake’s opposition to Enlightenment can be depicted in this picture, and shows his belief that art is good, and science is bad.

Alexandre Koyre was a French philosopher who wrote on the history and philosophy of science. Koyre focused on Galileo, Plato, and Isaac Newton. The scientific revolution of the 17th century was unique because it marked the rise of modern science. Koyre described the modern scientific revolution as a fundamental change in world outlook. Before this revolution, science was just an understanding of nature dependent on philosophy, mathematics, and technology. And the revolution, albeit it may not be the deepest revolution of human thought, but it is the most profound. It is a complete ideological “transformation”, and modern physics is a product of this transformation. He focuses on two characteristics to describe the scientific revolution, the collapse of the well-ordered universe, the cosmos, and the shift from mathematicalizastion of nature to the idea of geometric space. These two characteristics can be boiled down to the mathematicalization of nature, and the mathematicalization of science. Koyre was a strong follower of Plato and researched a lot about Galileo. Koyre emphasized the positive influence of Platonism on Galileo, where he too believed that Nature was written in geometric languages such as circles and triangles. He too, using the idea of geometricization of space, replaced Aristotle’s cosmological space with Euclid’s geometric space, not only destroying Aristotle’s concept of a crystal celestial sphere, but also used experimental and mathematical methods to establish the kinematics of objects. Thus, all considerations based on value and meaning became merely subjective, and were replaced by materialistic ones.

This painting is produced by Joseph Write of ‘Darby’, titled 《An Experiment on a Bird in the Air Pump》. Although some of his paintings have been associated with the Industrial Revolution of the 18th century, Wright’s principle interest was in the rendering of light and shade offered by such subjects, just as in this painting. This is a complex painting that appears to tell some narrative, and at the center, a bright light that emphasizes the important aspect of the painting. This picture depicts an experiment of a bird (a cockatoo) in an air pump. The device has a crank that when turned, air is sucked out. There is a gathering of individuals perhaps trying to learn about the experiment, or even perhaps being entertained.  There are many different reactions to the experiment. The two girls light by the candle is watching in horror. The man behind them appears to try to teach the girls about the experiment, rather than comfort them. The boy on the left is interested, craning his head toward the air pump. The man holding the watch on the left appears to be a typical gentleman, and the older man on the right seems to be thinking. In this painting, there perhaps is a relationship to the Enlightenment, as he focuses on the aspect of light.

The Baconian method, developed by Sir Francis Bacon, is an investigative or methodical observation, and is to believe the first formulation of the modern scientific method. It is a means of studying and interpreting natural phenomena.Bacon experimentalist despised thought experiments and insisted on making accurate and practical experimental reports. His method of induction is much more complex than generalizing from observations, his method describes the requirements for making careful, systematic observations necessary to produce quality facts. And those facts could establish additional axioms. He argues that classical knowledge building techniques were not solely based on facts, but on extremely general, ill proven deductions. Some historians, however, believed that the Bacon movement was a tendency to exaggerate and was not beneficial to the development of science. On the other hand, some argue that although Bacon did not contribute to the development of classical science, but has opened up to many new fields, such as magnetism and thermal research. Research and development model and tools used are more like the ones today than the ones of classical science, and by the mid-18th century, research has become increasingly systematic. For example, although chemical instruments and techniques have been developed long before the industrial revolution, it s only after when people carefully re-evaluated the chemical business and its technology to use for experimental exploration. The number of scientists, and groups made up of scientists grew a lot during this period. Scientists such as Galileo and Newton approached science with this method.

By 1804, they returned with various specimens collected in the New World during the five years. But when he returned,Napoleon gave him grants and his specimens would be displayed in the Museum of Natural History. He would eventually return to Berlin. Bonplan, on the other hand, stayed in Paris, and worked closely with the Napoleon and his wife. Bonplan eventually became the garden supervisor of the Chateau de Malmaison, where many of the seeds he had brought from the Americas were cultivated.

Natural history is a term coined by the West. It first appeared in the book 《博物新编》, which introduced western modern physics, chemistry, astronomy, meteorology, and zoology. The term natural science, on the other hand, had nothing to do with natural history.  It differs from Natural Philosophy in that it attempts to establish a literature and set of reference standards for empirical investigation. The term natural history slowly disappeared after the 1930s. The main reason was that as Western science took root in China, it included various disciplines such as botany, zoology, mineralogy, and physiology. On the other hand, natural philosophy is the study of nature, focusing on discovering the principles and reasons that dominate the deduction of internal logic of ideas. It focuses on reasonings and explanations about nature. It is also less concerned about the mathematics. Natural history, on the other  hand, is more focused on collecting and identify facts, describing them, and then categorizes them. Natural history is often described as the precursor natural philosophy, and natural philosophy the precursor of natural science.

This is a painting of Empress Catherine II visiting the scholar Mikhail Lomonosov. It is by an artist named Ivan Kuzmich Fedorov. At the time of Catherine’s accession, Russia was still regarded as a distance provincial wilderness by many Europeans. Empress Catherine, who understood the power of image and symbol, sought to change this negative view by creating a powerful, modern, wealthy country ruled over by a sophisticated, enlightened autocrat. She thus purposefully became a patron of literature, science, the arts, and education. She founded elementary schools, academies, and libraries across Russia. Russian scholars and artists were sent abroad to learn about Western examples. Foreign scientists, architects, and artists were attracted to Petersburg to enrich the city. In this painting, she visits Mikhail Lomonosov, a Russian polymath, sceintists, and writer, who made important contributions to literature, education, and science. In the picture, she appears to be listening to Lomonosov explain an experiment, and based on her expression, she seems to be extremely interested. Around the room are scattered instruments, paintings, and books. Each individual is wearing expensive clothing. Among Lomonosov’s many discoveries, was the atmosphere of Venus and Mass Conservation in chemical reactions. Catherine had encouraged Mikhail Lomonosov’s establishment of the University of Moscow.

There are various reasons for the limitations on growth of science in universities. Before the 15th century, the Black Plague, Hundred Years’ War, and Religious movements purged many of the Universities of Germany, Britain, and France. Although these partial and temporary reasons became invalid by the 17th century, it was still clear that most contributions were not made in universities. The article argues that the position of the university in society is what causes restrictions in the development of science. Because the purpose of university is to provide lawyers, civil servants, priests, and doctors.  This placed an emphasis on philosophy and classical works as more important. Thus, even those who were studying medicine, it was more important to be able to read classics. Clearly, antinomy, physiology, and other sciences saw a decline of importance in Universities at this time. With decreasing importance, it is not hard to see why Universities failed to become the center of new scientific achievement during the scientific revolution. Until the end of the 18th century, universities could not make a difference in promoting science, thus there was not inspiration to further scientific thought. In any case, more favorable conditions for the development of science emerged outside of the university. At the time, science was dominated by scientific societies and academies, which had largely replaced universities as centers of scientific research and development. Societies and academies were also the backbone of the maturation of the scientific profession.

This painting is titled “Coalbrookdale by Night”, created in 1801 by artist Philip James De Loutherbourg. This is a painting of a newly industrialized village of Shropshire in western England. The artists Loutherbourg contrasts a raging blaze from the factory with an idyllic woodland and rustic landscape. Dark colors are used to paint the structures and its inhabitants, and thus are overwhelmed by the burst of bright light created by the Bedlam furnaces. Flame and smoke are at the center of the picture. While the inhabits are hurrying to carry the raw materials out of the town.  The mood of the painting seems to suggest a negative one. The artists paints industrialization in a negative connotation, suggesting that it is bad for England and its people. The industrialization was a period of time of where England’s economy shifted from a mainly agrarian one to increased productivity, a rapidly growing economy, and international trade. On the other hand, there were intellectuals and artists were horrified by what the Industrial Revolution entailed. The Romantic movement was openly hostile towards this.

The role of science and technology in the First Industrial Revolution is still contested. On one hand, science has also penetrated into all aspects of European civilized society and culture. Many would argue that the nature of early British industrialization and its economic advances depend on specialized scientific training. Or at the least, scientists and educated engineers can sometimes interact closely. On the other hand, many support the thesis the technical innovations of the industrial revolution of the century, were made by craftsmen, technicians, and engineers, and all of them having achieved results without benefiting from scientific theories and no scientific straining. The article argues that it is a myth that theoretical innovation during the scientific revolution promoted technological process, that these stories about famous engineers being guided by major scientific figures are false. Graduating students often lacked real practical experience and little knowledge, and thus the process of industrialization could not be relied on by civilian engineers. This, in part, is due to the huge gap between theoretical and practical knowledge. In one example, two committees, one of mathematicians and natural scientists, and the other composed of experienced builders, were asked to solve a questionnaire about Telford’s design. However, there was little that could be combined. Another reason, as argued by Issac Milner, stated that science is in fact not ready to assist with technology, that the deep theoretical science is simply not needed.

In Dali's work, ants are a common theme, often representing death and decay, and is most obvious on the gold watch located in the left corner.  The monstrous fleshy character that is draped across the center of the painting looks completely alien. However, it is an approximation of Dali's own profile. The landscape is desolate and perhaps inspired by his homeland, the Cataln Coast. Dali paints his fantastical vision in a meticulous and realistic manner, he integrates the real and the imaginary in order to help question the current state of reality.

Cosmology focuses on the science of the origin and development of the universe. 

The article begins with the question that if the universe is indeed infinite, how can we establish a cosmologe if in fact, cosmology requires the ability to treat the universe as a whole. How can an infinite universe be combined as a whole? 

Modern cosmology has two sources, the theoretical source is from Einstein's General Theory of Relativity, and its observational source is the discovery of large-scale redshift phenomena. In Einstein's theory of special relativey, he broke the absoluteless of time and space and connected them with motion. And in his general theory of relativity, as long as the average density of the universe is not zero, space cannot be described as a flat Euclidean space, but must be curved. In short, his model of the universe is not only finite and unbounded, but also static. 

Immediately after Einstein's general theory of relativity, people become constructing their own models, scientists such as Friedman began creating their own models and cosmology became lively. The concept of an expanding universe opened up many paths, for example, the introduction of the Big Bang model. Many studies aim to test how old the universe is, how cold it was, and what kinds of chemical elements existed.

This is a oil painting titled Claude Bernard and pupils by Leon-Augustin Lhermitte. This photo shows Bernard with his students in his college labratory in France. Although animal experimentation can be traced back to the ancient world, it was the nineteenth century physiologist Claude Bernard that sent out the principles of experimental medicine in life sciences. Bernard is well known for his discoveries concerning the role of pancreas in digestion, the glcogenic function of the liver, and the regulation of the blood supply by the vasomotor nerves. He also introduced the concept of milieu interieur, describing the dynamic internal physilogical equilibrium that sustains an organism in an external environment that may vary. This would become the underlying principle of homeostasis. In the photo, we see Claude disecting what appears to be rabbit with a scapel, removing the blood and organs and collecting it in a large bowl. It is a visualization of perhaps Claude's experimentation on glycogen, where he would force a stream of water through hepatic vessels in the still-warm liver immediately following the death of the animal. Today, more than a century after his death, his basic methodological assumptions are still central to the theory and practice of biomedicine.

Natural history is the environmental and life knowledge accumulated by mankind in the process of directly dealing with living environment, so it has distinct local and diverse characteristics. Today's natural history, especially in Western civilization, is strongly tried with the development of modern experiment science of mathematics, and in turn is inline with the modern science of seeking strength. Thus, the goal of natural history has become more about conquering and controlling natural resources. This view of nature has led people to a sense of arrogancy and superiority toward nature, which can be reflected in today's various environmental and ecological problems. However, primitive natural history isn't like this, their attitude toward nature is pious and sentimental. This is what modern matehmatical experimental science, and therefore what modern natural history ignores. Today, there is a strong split between man and nature through classification and social management of plants and animals. Lastly, modern natural history is mainly born and bred in the lines of rational science and mathematical epxerimenting of Western civilizations, and thus is very limited. In order to achieve an understanding of science, we must together as one human civilization.

The article states that knowldge is not only the familarity and understanding of things, but the process of dealing with the envirnment as well. Thus, definition of knowledge includes theoretical, practical, social, humanistic, and today's so called natural knowledge. Thus, there must be natural history where there is civilization, and today we have created an irreplacable natural history.
