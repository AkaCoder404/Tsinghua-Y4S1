In the Middle Ages, the universe was viewed as a great machine whose creation and functioning reflected harmony in both proportion and symmetry. These qualities were imparted through the design by its Creator. Scholars of this period conceived the Christian God as the Great Geometer whose compass served as the “tool of creation”. They believed that God brought order to a divided earth in chaos. Things that look like the earth, sun, and stars, as well as the formless chaos awaiting its geometric formation in the middle. We can see in this picture, the Circle God is drawing is filled with This picture is a 13th century illustration was the frontispiece of the French Bible Moralisee. It depicts this belief of sacred geometry, which ascribes symbolic and sacred meanings to certain geometric shapes and certain geometric proportions. These geometric designs were used in the design and construction of religious structures, such as churches, temples, and mosques. And to pursue these principles was therefore to pursue and worship God.

During the Pre-Socartics era, Greek philosophers had started to consider the possibility that the Earth was not at the center of the universe nor was it stationary. For example, Anaximander proposed that the cosmos was infact spherical, and that the earth was stationary at its center. While the Pythagoreans proposed that the cosmos was spherical, that there was a fire in the center of the cosmos, and that the earth, moon, sun, and five visible planets rotated around this central fire. Aristarchus later proposed that the sun was the center of the cosmos and the earth rotated around the sun. A major reason for the dominance of the geocentric and geostatic model of the cosmos was Aristotle’s physics. His “physics” reflects his account of the natural world. There are two main differences between Aristotle’s physics and our modern physics.
First, Aristotle’s physics was qualitative, not quantitative. However, he did believe that mathematics was the proper language for describing the physical world. The second major difference between Aristotle’s physics and modern physics, is that his physics encompassed the entire natural world, and did not separate biology from astronomy. He proposed that the cosmos could be split into two separate realms, terrestrial and celestial. He describes that everything in the terrestrial realm could be split into four qualities, and describe how each element had a natural motion and a natural place. One of the key differences is the idea of substance. Unlike modern physics, he believed that the cosmos is not made up of elementary particles, but substances. Aristotle believed that shape, organization, and final cause, are essential to the understanding of substance, or formed matter.
Aristotle physics was a fundamental understanding of matter and space that was consistent with logic and experience, which makes him an important figure in the advancement of science. Other main theories of Aristotelian physics are natural position, gravity, infinite universe, and continuum theory.

The photo is a 16^th^ century engraving of  a crowned Ptolemy,
or Cladius Ptolemaeus, guided by the Muse of Astronomy, Urania, from Margarita
Philosophica by Gregor Reisch, showing an early confluence between Ptolemy and
the rulers of Ptolemaic Egypt. Ptolemy was a Greek-Egyptian mathematician, astronomer,
geographer, astrologer, and music theorist. In the photo, we see an instrument used
by Ptolemy, a quadrant to measure the altitude of the moon. Urania, a character
of Greek mythology, was the muse of astronomy. She dresses in a cloak and keeps
her eyes and attention focused on the heavens. She is often represented with a
celestial globe to which she points to with a little staff (located in the
lower left). Ptolemy is most remembered because of his development of the
geocentric cosmological system.  He is
the author of numerous scientific theories which were of continuing importance
to both Islamic and European Science. Perhaps his most important work, the
Almagest, contained his work on astronomy, philosophy, and mathematics.

The Hellenistic period of ancient Greek and Mediterranean history between the death of Alexander the Great in 323 BCE and the emergence of the Roman Empire. During this era, there was a
transition from the concept of philosophers to the title of mathematicians, which
not only relate to what we know as mathematical research, but any type of
learning.  Aristotle argued that we must first study arithmetic and geometry to help us define physics. Although mathematics existed long before this era, these new mathematicians made many advancements by trying to rigorously prove theorems, and the discoveries made by these Greek mathematicians, including Pythagoras and Euclid, are still used in mathematical teaching today. Important developments include basic rules of geometry, formal mathematical proof, discoveries in number theory, mathematical
analysis, and applied mathematics. For example, the article states that in his work, “The Elements of Geometry”, does not contain much propositions and proofs that are discovered but him, but is highly systematic, a clear, coherent, and coordinated collection of mathematical proofs. Starting from a few self-evident axioms, and according to logical principles, he deduced a series of propositions as a basis, and created a general structure of deduction of axioms, a basis of geometry. Another famous mathematician, as well as astronomer and geographer Archimedes, is known for devising the first system of latitude and longitude, calculated the circumference of the earth, and the “Sieve of Eratosthenes” algorithm for identifying prime numbers. The advancement of mathematics during this era helped define its role. In previous centuries, the role of mathematics and its relationship with philosophy could be considered
uncertain. However, in this era, mathematics has become its own field in science. The clear, systematic, and mythological displays of proofs by these mathematicians is what makes it different than classical Greek science. They also recognized that mathematics could be applied to solve physical problems,
in areas such as astronomy.
